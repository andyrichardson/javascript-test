### 1. Forking

Make a fork of this repository, you will use this fork for the remainder of the challenge.

_Tip: You will likely want to create commits after completing each task._

### 2. Number List

Navigate to the folder `1-number-list`. In here, you will find two files `NumberList.ts` and `NumberList.test.ts`.

`NumberList` is a basic implementation of a linked list. Take a moment to look through class and its methods.

`Numberlist.test.ts` contains tests for the NumberList class. Again, take some time to look through code.

#### 1 Constructor

In the NumberList class, complete the constructor function.

#### 2 Constructor Test

In the test file, complete the test to ensure that construction completes when a value and next node are provided.

#### 2(a) Getter Tests _(optional)_
